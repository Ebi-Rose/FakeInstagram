# FakeInstagram
In this mini project, I explore using HTML, CSS and a very small amount of Javascript to replicate a responsive Instagram homepage
This uses HTML5 video tag with invisible controls to disguise that it is a video as well as autoplay and loop again wiwth the same aim.
It also uses form validations, responsive CSS Layouts depending on screen size though some needs to change.
